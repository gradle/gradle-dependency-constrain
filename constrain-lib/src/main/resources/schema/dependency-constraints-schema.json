  "description": "Defines a set of constraints to be applied to a Gradle Build. When used as a Gradle Plugin, constraints in this file will constrain the project buildscript and project dependencies. When leveraged as a Gradle feature, these constraints apply to all configurations in all scopes. \n\n FORMATTING RULES:\n In addition to this schema, there are formatting requirements that can not be enforced by JSON schema.\n Rules:\n \t- All indentation MUST use two spaces.\n \t- All keys MUST have the colon `:` directly after the key name.\n \t- All non-map and non-object values MUST be on the same line as the key.\n \t- The `dependencyConstraints` array must be sorted lexicographically. See the description on `#/$defs/dependencyConstraints` for more information.\n \t- The file MUST be terminated with a newline.\n These formatting rules are enforced by Gradle when the file is loaded. The goal is to ensure that automated tooling (eg. Dependabot and Rennotate) will generate a consistent file that won't cause annoying white space diffs. ",
